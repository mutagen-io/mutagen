	// which case the Go standard library and runtime (and Mutagen) don't retry
	// the operation because it's safer to err on the side of failure.
	//
	// In any case, this isn't ever going to be an issue for Mutagen in practice
	// because (a) EINTR is exceedingly unlikely here, (b) this code is only
	// used in Mutagen right before a process exits (usually in a defer that
	// ignores errors), and (c) Mutagen already has to be careful to avoid
	// multiple code paths managing locks on the same file (because POSIX
	// releases all fcntl locks for a file if any file descriptor for that lock
	// in the process is closed).
