// Close closes the process' streams and terminates the process using heuristics

// mutagen-io/mutagen#223 and mutagen-io/mutagen-compose#11.
//
// First, if a non-negative, non-zero termination delay has been specified, then
// this method will wait (up to the specified duration) for the process to exit
// on its own. If the process exits on its own, then its standard input, output,
// and error streams are closed and this method returns.
//
// Second, the process' standard input stream will be closed. The process will
// then be given up to one second to exit on its own. If it does, then the
// standard output and error streams are closed and this method returns. Closure
// of the standard input stream is recognized by the Mutagen agent as indicating
// termination and should thus be sufficient to cause termination for transport
// processes that forward this closure correctly.
//
// Third, on POSIX systems only, the process will be sent a SIGTERM signal. The
// process will then be given up to one second to exit on its own. If it does,
// then the standard output and error streams are closed and this method
// returns. Reception of SIGTERM is also recognized by the Mutagen agent as
// indicating termination and should thus be sufficient to cause termination for
// transport processes that correctly forward this signal. Windows lacks a
// directly equivalent termination mechanism (the closest analog would be
// sending WM_CLOSE, but reception and processing of such a message may have
// unpredictable effects in different runtimes).
//
// Finally, the process will be sent a SIGKILL signal (on POSIX) or terminated
// via TerminateProcess (on Windows). This method will then wait for the process
// to exit before closing the standard output and error streams and returning.
//
// This method guarantees that, by the time it returns, the underlying transport
// process has terminated and its associated standard input, output, and error
// stream handles in the current process have been closed. The error returned by
// this function will be that returned by os/exec.Cmd.Wait. Note, however, that
// this method cannot guarantee that any or all child processes spawned by the
// transport process have terminated by the time this method returns. This is
// mostly due to operating system API limitations. Specifically, POSIX provides
// no away to restrict subprocesses to a single process group and therefore
// cannot guarantee that a call to killpg will reach all the subprocesses that
// have been spawned. Even if that were possible, there is no mechanism to wait
// for an entire process group to exit, and it's not well-defined exactly what
// signals or stream closures should be used to signal those processes anyway,
// because Mutagen is not privy to the internals of the transport process(es).
// Windows, while it does provide a "job" API for managing and terminating
// process hierarchies, is even less nuanced in its process signaling mechanism
// (essentially offering only the equivalent of SIGKILL) and it's thus even less
// clear how to signal termination there with arbitrary and opaque process
// hierarchies. We thus rely on a certain level of well-behavedness when it
// comes to transport processes. Specifically, we assume that they know how to
// correctly handle and forward standard input closure and SIGTERM signals, and
// that they'll terminate when their underlying agent process terminates.
