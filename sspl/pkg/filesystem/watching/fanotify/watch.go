			// and to ensure that we're seeing changes to the target itself
			// (though, in this case, we do it more for stability since we know
			// the volume mounts aren't likely to disappear).
			//
			// Second, with fanotify, we're watching an entire filesystem, and
			// thus we may see events that occur outside of the mount point that
			// we're watching, especially if that mount point isn't mounting the
			// filesystem root. If the event can't be referenced by a path
			// beneath the mount point that we're using with open_by_handle_at,
			// then a read of its path will result in "/". For example, watching
			// container volumes that are just bind-mounted directories from the
			// host filesystem will result in a watch of the entire host
			// filesystem, but a modification to a path outside of the volume
			// directory on the host filesystem will yield a notification with
			// a path resolving to "/" (when resolved relative to the mount
			// point). This is basically designed to indicate that the event
			// occurred outside the mount point. Fortunately, as long as the
			// target location can be referenced by a path beneath the mount
			// point being used as the reference point for open_by_handle_at, a
			// valid path will be returned. This means (e.g.) that a single
			// volume mounted in multiple containers (even at different mount
			// points) will still yield event notifications with paths relative
			// to the mount point within the container performing the watch.
