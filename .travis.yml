# Run tests, upload the coverage report, and build bundles.
#
# We have to run a quick build (for the current platform only) before running
# tests because the tests rely on the agent bundle being available. We may need
# to switch this to a testing build if we start invoking Docker from macOS with
# Linux containers. We don't want to do a full build to start with though
# because that can take a while.
#
# We run a few different testing cycles. The first is our primary test cycle for
# behavior and coverage reports. The second test cycle enables race detection,
# but we use a smaller synchronization root for integration tests in this case
# because the tests incur about an order-of-magnitude slowdown due to the race
# detector. The third test cycle (which occurs only on Linux) is for the 386
# architecture (where race detection isn't available anyway).
#
# We fold coverage report uploading into the script section to mirror the
# behavior on AppVeyor (which is necessary because AppVeyor's after_test doesn't
# seem to fail the build if an upload fails (which we want to do)).
#
# Finally, our build mode depends on what platform we're on. Only macOS is
# capable of building release bundles.
