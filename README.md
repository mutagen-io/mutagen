# Mutagen

Mutagen is a new kind of remote development tool that enables your existing
local tools to work with code in remote environments like cloud servers and
containers. It does this by providing high-performance real-time
[file synchronization](https://mutagen.io/documentation/synchronization) and
flexible [network forwarding](https://mutagen.io/documentation/forwarding).
It supports synchronization and forwarding between
[local systems](https://mutagen.io/documentation/transports/local),
[SSH-accessible locations](https://mutagen.io/documentation/transports/ssh),
and [Docker containers](https://mutagen.io/documentation/transports/docker).


## Getting started

The best way to understand Mutagen and its features is to read the

[contribution documentation](CONTRIBUTING.md).


## Security

Mutagen takes security very seriously. If you believe you have found a security
issue with Mutagen, please practice responsible disclosure practices and send an
email directly to [security@mutagen.io](mailto:security@mutagen.io) instead of
opening a GitHub issue. For more information, please see the
[security documentation](SECURITY.md).


## Versioning and support

Mutagen uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for tracking releases.
Before Mutagen reaches version 1.0, each minor release series will be supported
for one month after the first release in the next minor release series (e.g.
v0.10.x will be supported until one month after the release of v0.11.0).

The builds for each minor release series are pinned to the same Go minor release
and dependency versions used for developing that series (though patch releases
will be incorporated if they contain security fixes).

We reserve the right to break or bend these rules if necessary for the sake of
security, e.g. discontinuing support for a minor release to which a security fix
cannot be backported or upgrading Go minor versions for a release series to
incorporate important security fixes. Features marked as experimental may also
see breakage when necessary, though we will endeavor to keep this to a minimum.


## Building

Please see the [build instructions](BUILDING.md).


## External projects

Users have built a number of cool projects to extend and integrate Mutagen into
their workflows:

- [**Mutagen Helper**](https://github.com/gfi-centre-ouest/mutagen-helper) is a
  tool that makes the orchestration of synchronization sessions even easier by
  letting you define sessions with configuration files that live inside your
  codebase. Thanks to [**@Toilal**](https://github.com/Toilal)!
- [**docker-magento-mutagen**](https://github.com/mage2click/docker-magento-mutagen)
  (from [Mage2click](https://mage2.click/)) is a Docker-based development
  environment for Magento that uses Mutagen for file synchronization. Thanks to
  [**@u-maxx**](https://github.com/u-maxx) and
  [**@shkoliar**](https://github.com/shkoliar)!
- [**MutagenMon**](https://github.com/rualark/MutagenMon) is a Python-based GUI
  for monitoring Mutagen sessions. Thanks to
  [**@rualark**](https://github.com/rualark)!
- [**mutagenmon**](https://github.com/andrewmed/mutagenmon) is an alternative
  (Go-based) native GUI for Mac, for monitoring Mutagen sessions, provides apple
  notarized builds.
